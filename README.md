# Dragonfly.UmbracoTheming #

A Theming system for Umbraco created by [Heather Floyd](https://www.HeatherFloyd.com).

For a general explanation, see the article:

 [How to Create Multiple Unique Sites in One Installation Using Theming and the Umbraco Grid](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/2016/unique-sites-using-theming/)

This package will install a few examples in the "Views" folder, along with a  Themes folder which includes an unstyled "starter" theme.
